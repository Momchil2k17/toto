# Toto Project Documentation

## Overview

The **Toto Project** is a demonstration of using AI to rapidly prototype and develop a complete project. 
All the code in this project was generated using AI tools, with only minimal edits and adjustments 
made manually. The entire project was completed in under 2 hours, showcasing the efficiency and 
potential of AI-assisted development.

### Purpose

This project is intended to serve as a portfolio piece to highlight:
- My ability to effectively collaborate with AI systems.
- My proficiency in designing and refining AI-generated code using precise and appropriate prompts.

## Project Features

1. **Main Web Page** (`index.html`)
   - The primary HTML file serves as the foundation of the project.
   - Includes references to external styles (`styles.css`) and scripts (`script.js`).

2. **Styling** (`styles.css`)
   - Custom CSS styles for an appealing visual layout.

3. **Interactivity** (`script.js`)
   - JavaScript functionality that enhances the user experience.

4. **Visuals** (`toto.png`)
   - An image used within the project for branding or design purposes.

5. **Git Version Control** (`.git`)
   - The project includes a Git repository for version control and collaboration.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the source files.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Explore the functionalities and visuals presented in the project.

## Acknowledgments
