# Toto Project Documentation

## Overview

The **Toto Project** is a demonstration of using AI to rapidly prototype and develop a simple lottery number game.  
All the code in this project was generated using AI tools, with only minimal edits and adjustments made manually.  
The entire project was completed in under 2 hours, showcasing the efficiency and potential of AI-assisted development.

### Purpose

This project serves as a portfolio piece to highlight:
- My ability to effectively collaborate with AI systems.
- My proficiency in designing and refining AI-generated code using precise and appropriate prompts.
- The power of AI to quickly generate functional and interactive projects.

## Project Features

### 1. **Lottery Game**
   - A simple lottery number generator game where users can interact and simulate a lottery experience.
   - Fun and interactive functionality for users to generate, check, and analyze numbers.

### 2. **Main Web Page** (`index.html`)
   - The HTML file serves as the foundation of the project, containing the structure of the lottery game interface.

### 3. **Styling** (`styles.css`)
   - Custom CSS styles provide an appealing and user-friendly layout.

### 4. **Interactivity** (`script.js`)
   - JavaScript code powers the lottery number generation, simulations, and additional interactivity.

## Button Functionalities

The game includes six buttons, each with specific functionality:

1. **Choose Automatically**:
   - Automatically selects a set of lottery numbers for the user.

2. **Check Numbers**:
   - Compares the user-selected or automatically chosen numbers against winning numbers to determine matches.

3. **Clear Numbers**:
   - Clears all selected or generated numbers, resetting the interface.

4. **Run 1M Simulations**:
   - Simulates one million lottery draws and calculates statistical outcomes, such as how often certain numbers win.

5. **Stats**:
   - Displays the results of previous simulations, providing insights and analysis of winning patterns.

6. **Clear Stats**:
   - Resets all statistics to start fresh, clearing any previously calculated outcomes.
